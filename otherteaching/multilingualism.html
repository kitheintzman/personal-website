<h2>Teaching with multilingual students</h2>
<h3>Or, why I don’t care what language you read material in</h3>

<br>

<p>Non-native speakers are frequently disadvantaged in their classrooms. This can happen when native speakers speak quickly, when readings are only made available in the language of instruction, and with the implicit assumption that students will only draw on sources from the language of instructions. These are equity concerns.</p>

<p>Equity concerns are pedagogical concerns.</p> 

<p>Every one of these practices relates to bigger values of the humanities, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>developing nuanced understandings of equity</li> 
<li>learning about how language skills open possibilities of cross-cultural exchange</li> 
<li>contemplating clear communication</li>
<li>paying attention to the politics of language (syntax)</li>
<li> understanding the imperfections of translation</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>1. Strategies if you speak too quickly</h3></p> 

<p><b>Pay attention to cadence.</b> Cadence is the combination of your rhythm and inflection, and part of public speaking is using the rhythm and tone of your voice strategically. Speaking slowly, for instance, does not have to mean speaking monotonously. Ask yourself which words in each sentence are most important and emphasize those. Think of it as a dramatic reading of your point.</p>

<p><b>Be upfront about this with your audience.</b> It is okay to admit that you are still developing your skills (as an instructor and as a student) in this area of public speaking. School is about learning and improving, for instructors and for students. Invite the audience to give a physical signal if you are speaking too fast. Use this invitation as a self-prompt to look at your audience when talking.</p> 

<p><b>Practice.</b> You can do this with trusted colleagues as well as with less familiar audiences. Speaking in front of strangers, instructors, peers, and even trusted friends can be intimidating, and being nervous and being unpracticed both make us break our cadence. If you have a class presentation coming up, ask members of your dormitory if they would be willing to listen to you, and state that you are willing to do the same for them.</p>

<br>

<h3>2. Assigning materials that are not in the language of instruction</h3>

<p>Depending on the kind of class that you are teaching, the options for teaching with different languages are going to vary. Here are some examples of how to do so and the potential values and pitfalls:

<ul>
<li>English Literature</li>
<ul>
<li>This might be the least intuitive place to engage in this practice in the Anglophone academy. The greatest limitation is, of course, that in an English Literature class (unlike in a comparative literature class) word choice and sentence structure of a particular text is likely to be central to the analytics that you are developing with your students and thus would be altered in translation. However, it is possible that in some cases you might prize understanding of the narrative structure of a text over individual words.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>History</li>
<ul>
<li>If you are teaching with primary sources, it is highly likely that some of them have been translated into the language of instruction after originals were written in other languages. If you are teaching history of anywhere outside of the Anglophone world, you probably have a wealth of secondary literature in multiple languages. If you are teaching about the Anglophone world, some secondary sources might also be available translated into other languages. Remember that there is a burden placed on non-Anglophone colleagues to translate their own work (often an expensive process). Providing a non-English original can draw attention to and critique Anglocentrism. It can, at least on occasion, ease the mental burden of students who can more easily digest a work in their own native language. As historians, we know that the production of a <em>lingua franca</em> is far from a neutral process. 
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<ul>
<li>Much of the canon that students learn in a philosophy class is already translated. Whether teaching Kant’s <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (<em>Kritik der reinen Vernunft</em> or Frantz Fanon’s <em>Black Skins, White Masks</em> (<em>Peau noire, masques blancs</em>), these works were not only originally published in other languages, but, because of their canonical status, they have also been translated into yet other languages.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>3. Explicitly inviting your students to conduct multilingual work for their research projects</h3>

<p>I have never seen a syllabus that forbids students from working with primary sources or secondary source materials in other languages. However, until I started explicitly inviting my students to work in the language of their choice, none did so. Once I began including a language policy in my courses that actively invited students to work in any language that they felt confident in, I found that their projects opened up both geographically and analytically. It also enabled more freedom over their object of study. The overwhelming majority of students who have taken up this offer have worked in their native language, often drawing on historical topics that they felt more connected to. Lots of students who are not native speakers, however, still choose to only use sources of the language of instruction in order to continue developing language skills. It is my hope that some native speakers of the language of instruction use this as an opportunity to similarly develop skills in their non-native languages as well. </p>

<br>

<h3>Reasons to do this</h3>
<ul>
<li>To gain awareness that reading in a language not your own is far more time-consuming than for native speakers/readers. 
<li>To consider who might <em>not</em> be taking your class because of language barriers and to make your class more accessible to them. 
<li>To teach your students the politics of language.
<li>To encourage your students in multilingualism.
<li>To provincialize the language of instruction. 
<li>Because some of your sources aren’t originally in English anyway. 
<li>Because it can bring questions about translation right into the classroom.  
</ul>

<h3>Reasons that you might not want to do this</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are not teaching the “content” of a text, but a particular iteration of it, where issues like the language and edition really matter.
<li>You are worried about finding adequate translations.
<li>You don’t trust your students not to misrepresent material in languages that you are not competent in.
<li>You are working with Teaching Assistants, and this might be asking them to run before they can walk when it comes to training them as teachers (this can impact their labour hours). 
</ul>

<p>Admittedly, as a teacher there are languages that I am more competent in than others, just like there are subgenres of my discipline that I know better than others. This means that I am better prepared to advise a student on finding online resources in French than I am in Portuguese. I consider this an opportunity to grow. In some cases, it means collecting resources over time. In other cases, it means reaching out across my network to discover online repositories for different subsections. Sometimes it means discussing search terms that I would use in my own native language first as a starting point with students, before they begin their own research.</p>
