<h2>Lecturer</h2>

	<h3>Harvard University:</h3>
	<h4>Spring 2020: <em>Biopolitical Animals: Nonhumans in Medicine, Science, and Society</em></h4> 
	<ul>	
		<li>"This course had very engaging discussions and interesting lectures. All of the readings were very useful and intuitively reinforced the topics of each week. Kit also did an amazing job at facilitating discussions during class and being very responsive to questions. Her feedback on assignments definitely allowed me to grow as a writer and critical thinker."</l>
	<br>
	<li>"The material covered by the first part of the class, a historical survey of important ways of thinking about non–human animals in the tradition from Aristotle to Foucault, was interesting, important, and unique among Harvard's animal–related offerings. The ideas of each week were covered in enough depth to explore what made them distinctive, while the survey progressed rapidly enough to allow clear comparisons to be drawn, for example between Aristotle's virtue–ethical and Bouffon's utility–focused anthropocentric evaluations of animals. Furthermore, these subjects were introduced using well–chosen texts, which illustrated distinctive features of each author's thought in an efficient, light reading load. The museum "field trip" and associated assignments were creative, out of the box, and thought–provoking. The range of animal–related artifacts shown at the museum were especially effective at conveying the amount of work historians have to put into understanding a culture before attempting to interpret particular pieces of evidence to advance an argument. Relatedly, the first few months of the course did an excellent job of introducing me to the basic principles of practicing history—the variety of types of sources, what kind of information can be gained from each, caveats such as preservation bias, and what makes a topic relatively easy to study (like Darwin) or harder (like paleoarcheological artifacts). This was accomplished piece by piece through examples we worked through in class, without being boring or didactic."</li>
		<br>
	<li>"This course provided a lot of in person discussion and gave each student in the class the opportunity to contribute to class discussions. The structure of the course was also very flexible and catered to the needs of each student."</li>
	</ul>
<h4>Fall 2019: <em>Sugar, Spice, and Science: Commerce, Colonialism and the Making of a Global History of Science</h4></em>
<ul>
	<li>"I liked that we got to delve deeply into one particular topic. I feel like other seminars just touch on a variety of things. It was cool to "own" a particular topic and be the "expert" in the room on it. I also enjoyed learning from my classmates. The presentations were all interesting. Kit did a good job of tailoring her support. I liked that she sent us each a video/links to help us with technical issues. That was very thoughtful. I really enjoyed the feedback form we filled out at the end of each class."</li>
	<br>
	<li>"If you have any interest at all in colonialism or imperialism, check out this course. The premise is that each student selects a particular commodity from a curated list. Then, each week, one student gives a presentation on their commodity using StoryMap. The final project is a polished version of your Story Map. So, the good thing is that you get to know A LOT about one particular commodity, and then for the other commodities, you get to see interesting presentations on them. The class discussions are thought–provoking. Kit raises a lot of questions around decolonizing language, the role of slavery in western imperialism, what it means for something to be scientific, what a commodity is, and different theories of science (i.e. why the diffusionist model ignores the important role of non–western cultures in creating science). This course was a refreshing break from HistSci's typical courses, which are pretty Eurocentric and don't really talk about how science has been used to harm marginalized people for centuries."</li>
	<br>
	<li>"Dr. Heintzman is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about her work. This is apparent immediately, and transfers in the care and personal investment she has for each of her students and their academic work."</li>
</ul>

<h4>J-Term Intensive 2015: <em>Catching Nature in the Act: Animals and Cinema (co-taught with Wythe Marshall)</em></h4>
	<p>No evaluations were taken for this two week intensive.</p>
<br>
<h3>SciencesPo:</h3>

	<h4>Spring 2017: <em>Paper Tales: Bureaucracy in Media, Politics, and History</em></h4>
	<ul>
		<li>“Hands down, the best professor I had throughout my years at SciencesPo. She is very engaging, the assignments were both creative and intellectually stimulating, the feedback given was always very well-thought out and useful. All in all, an amazing professor, who reaffirmed my trust in academia.”</li>
		<br>
		<li>“She was very passionate about her work and was able to channel this passion in her teaching. She organized assignments in a systematic and engaging manner, allowing students to work their way up to better grades. She provides very good feedback on assignments and also useful information prior to completing the assignment.”</li>
		<br>
		<li>“The class was a firework of didactic methods and included a huge variety of ideas and historic case studies. The feedback of the teacher was very precise and helpful. The microassignments really helped to get a deeper insight into the subjects of the respective sessions.”</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Fall 2016: <em>History of Sexuality in Europe</em></h4>
	<ul>
		<li>"Professor Heintzman is an amazing professor, and her course was incredibly engaging! Not only were students given all the tools to succeed, we were also given all the tools necessary for improvement. Feedback was incredibly detailed and helpful, and we were truly given the opportunity to engage with the material. We all felt that we had an ally in Professor Heintzman, who always demonstrated that she would fight for our best interests."</li>
		<br>
		<li>"This was my favorite class out of all the classes I had at SciencesPo. The class subject and the unconventional assignments sparked my interest and made me think outside the box. I learned quite a lot in this class and was encouraged to further pursue my interest in gender studies. The teacher chose creative, interactive methods each class, thus it was never boring or mundane."</li>
		<br>
		<li>"We always had really interesting discussions about material that many of us had never had the opportunity to study before, and the angle that we took in these discussions was also eye- opening. At first the "non-traditional" assignments that we were given confused me, but I learned to appreciate and even enjoy doing them as a refresher from the same old structure of essays and readings." </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Primary advisor feedback</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>"Kit is a great adviser! She gives very detailed feedback and seems genuinely interested/invested in my project. We meet in person once a week to go over project progress but she is also always responsive via email. I really have nothing but nice things to say - it's been a pleasure working with her."</li>
		<br>
		<li>"Although managing an off-campus relationship was difficult, I am so grateful I had Kit as my thesis advisor. Kit expertly led me through this entire process, asking provoking questions that lead my research in new, interesting directions, and giving great advice on different sources I could utilize. She was always willing to read the draftiest of drafts, which was key to the way I work and write. Two qualities are notable: Kit’s way of helping me to refine/crystallize what I am trying to argue, and her written feedback. I actually compared feedback with some friends on our work multiple times, and I always had the best feedback (in terms of length of comments, frequency of comments, line edits on language, and constructive questions/criticism on my thinking in writing). A weird thing happened second semester where lots of people kept asking me to review their work, and I think it’s totally because I became a better reviewer and editor, solely because of Kit’s excellent reviewing. I also am incredibly appreciative of Kit’s kindness, and her keeping-it-real-ness. The thesis is hard, and a lot of hand-holding, and Kit did an excellent job of holding my hand, comforting me, and reminding me what was important. All of this entirely makes up for not being able to meet in person as frequently."</li>
		<br>
		<li>"Kit is the best thesis adviser. She is extremely honest and thorough in her feedback -- also kind and communicative. It was a pleasure working on my project with her."</li>
