<ul>

	<ul>
		<li>“Hands down, the best professor I had throughout my years at SciencesPo. She is very engaging, the assignments were both creative and intellectually stimulating, the feedback given was always very well-thought out and useful. All in all, an amazing professor, who reaffirmed my trust in academia.”</li>
		<li>“She was very passionate about her work and was able to channel this passion in her teaching. She organized assignments in a systematic and engaging manner, allowing students to work their way up to better grades. She provides very good feedback on assignments and also useful information prior to completing the assignment.”</li>
		<li>“The class was a firework of didactic methods and included a huge variety of ideas and historic case studies. The feedback of the teacher was very precise and helpful. The microassignments really helped to get a deeper insight into the subjects of the respective sessions.”</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
<li>Fall 2016: History of Sexuality in Europe
	<ul>
		<li>“Professor Heintzman is an amazing professor, and her course was incredibly engaging! Not only were students given all the tools to succeed, we were also given all the tools necessary for improvement. Feedback was incredibly detailed and helpful, and we were truly given the opportunity to engage with the material. We all felt that we had an ally in Professor Heintzman, who always demonstrated that she would fight for our best interests.”</li>
		<li>“This was my favorite class out of all the classes I had at SciencesPo. The class subject and the unconventional assignments sparked my interest and made me think outside the box. I learned quite a lot in this class and was encouraged to further pursue my interest in gender studies. The teacher chose creative, interactive methods each class, thus it was never boring or mundane.”</li>
		<li>“We always had really interesting discussions about material that many of us had never had the opportunity to study before, and the angle that we took in these discussions was also eye- opening. At first the "non-traditional" assignments that we were given confused me, but I learned to appreciate and even enjoy doing them as a refresher from the same old structure of essays and readings.” </li>
