<h1>COVID-19</h1>
  <p>Since December 2020 I have been conducting oral history interviews with an eclectic group of people about their experiences of pandemic, and 2020-present more generally. These interviews are all publicly available and uploaded to the online archive, <a href="https://covid-19archive.org/s/archive/page/whoweare">A Journal of the Plague Year</a></p>
  <p>I start from the premise that everyone has a story to share, however, I also recognize that my own time and energy is finite. When I reach out to people directly it is generally for a few intersecting reasons: 1) I can imagine historians of the future writing stories about you; 2) I've come to believe in the importance of the academic principle "nothing about us without us" and I want those historians to have access to you; and 3) I worry that historians of our own moment collecting these interviews might not think to prioritize you. There is a long lag between my submitting an interview to the archive and it being uploaded. Here are a few of the interviews that have been submitted and uploaded.<p>
