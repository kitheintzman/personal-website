META NOTES: move out of personal website


<h1>QGIS</h1>
<aside>Presenter acknowledges the distinction between teaching with something OpenSource, such as QGIS, and something proprietary, like ARCGIS</aside>
<aside>This presenter happens to be particular adept at not assuming we know very  much  about a computer, desktop, windows</aside>
<ul>
<li>Notes that there is minimal difference between QGIS updates, because they are developed so regularly</li>
<li>Notes that QGIS is named for the location of a developer working on the project. When this example is Zanzibar, the room laughs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Natural Earth as a useful dumping ground for geographic data</h2>
<p>Add a "shapefile" to the map</p>
<aside>This stage is just noodling</aside>
<ul>
  <li>Recommends having a separate file for "shapefiles"; shapefiles can't read this, because it is binary</li>
  <li>dbf: database formate; other software can read this, such as an excel file</li>
  <li>prj: indicates the map production</li>
  <li>cpg (says he doesn't know)</li>
</ul>

<p>In  order to work  with hex codes for accessibility, one needs to know that a term like "copy color" code give me a hex code #d52554</p>
<aside>simple fix for programmers: allow me to see the hex code so that I know what I am copying</aside>


I so desperately want something that that gives me the capacity to check multiple hex contrasts

Notes for workshop feedback
teaching error: when you teach us to change a file name it makes the process of "catching up" when something goes wrong impossible to follow
Suggestion for tech intro sessions: publish your feedback data. I don't mean so  that  we can determine if you  are a good teacher. I mean to create a database of information for people working in accessibility and tech  to see where larger user benefits and struggles are.
