META NOTES: move out of personal website


<h1>QGIS</h1>
<aside>Presenter acknowledges the distinction between teaching with something OpenSource, such as QGIS, and something proprietary, like ARCGIS</aside>
<aside>This presenter happens to be particular adept at not assuming we know very  much  about a computer, desktop, windows</aside>
<ul>
<li>Notes that there is minimal difference between QGIS updates, because they are developed so regularly</li>
<li>Notes that QGIS is named for the location of a developer working on the project. When this example is Zanzibar, the room laughs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Natural Earth as a useful dumping ground for geographic data</h2>
<p>Add a "shapefile" to the map</p>
<aside>This stage is just noodling</aside>
<ul>
  <li>Recommends having a separate file for "shapefiles"; shapefiles can't read this, because it is binary</li>
  <li>dbf: database formate; other software can read this, such as an excel file</li>
  <li>prj: indicates the map production</li>
  <li>cpg (says he doesn't know)</li>
</ul>

<p>In  order to work  with hex codes for accessibility, one needs to know that a term like "copy color" code give me a hex code #d52554</p>
<aside>simple fix for programmers: allow me to see the hex code so that I know what I am copying</aside>


<h2>Limitations in using another's data set</h2>
<p>Indicates that it is not common practice for peopole producing/sharing this data. It is not common practice for this data to be released with information about the criteria used to determine what definital criteria was used in the production of the data. For instance what is "urban" at a global scale.</p> 


<h2>Other thoughts on the politics of this material</h2>
<p>I so desperately want something that that gives me the capacity to check multiple hex contrasts</p>
<p>A vestige of Eurocentric ideas about place as populated seems visible here. The territory doesn't exist in such a representation without people.</p>



Notes for workshop feedback
teaching error: when you teach us to change a file name it makes the process of "catching up" when something goes wrong impossible to follow
Suggestion for tech intro sessions: publish your feedback data. I don't mean so  that  we can determine if you  are a good teacher. I mean to create a database of information for people working in accessibility and tech  to see where larger user benefits and struggles are. 
At the current moment he is suggesting making the line thinner, which makes it less accessible for persons of low vision.  Currently he is discussing how ugly it is to have bigger lines are: those lines are easier to see for persons  of low vision. 
Another student just asked about how to show  the attribute table. I am  not alone in this problem. 
Another place where the speaker  is excelling is in the area of explaining basics like "left" and "right clicking"
SPEED IS ALWAYS THE PROBLEM: it takes time to look between the screen one is working on and look at the demo
I can't tell working with  the software if the titles of windows inside QGIS showing on the screen are default  names  because when I search in "help" I don't get responses for the terms,  eg. "Expression"
A student just had a question about this; after he reinstructed another student had to pause to have him repeat it. 
Immediately after noting that there are international (non-USA) projects uses an example of "Georgia" to refer to the USA-state, not the country.
