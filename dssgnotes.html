<h1>Fundamentals of Digital Scholarship</h1>

<p>Example  case is in letter correspondence networks.</p>

<p>Syntax: Digital Scholarship, including Digital History and Digital Humanities. <em>Digital scholarship</em> is a more neutral term.</p>

<p>Digital scholarship lends itself to interdisciplinary and awareness about the process. Believes that digital scholarship requires a transparency about the methods (because of the guesswork).</p>

<p>Speakers ascribed to the idea that more data = more information. Advocates that larger amounts of data do lend themselves to pattern recognition.</p>

<p>Use of machine learning to separate images from text based sources from a digitalized visual archive.</p>

<h2>What is data?</h2>

<p>Data requires variability</p>
<p>Information is "Data" + "Structure"</p>
<p>Data should be conceptualized as a human made structure of information. Data is not facts and it is not evidence. There is no such thing as raw data. All data is biased.</p>
<p>Digital data is data that a computer can understand.</p>
<p>Unstructured data: text (without an organization background); Semi-structured data (text: perhaps annotated or tagged or catalogued); Structured data (where is explicit structure organizing the data, such as a well defined spreadsheet. Structure is one of the places where "bias" enters the data. Such as deciding which pieces of data to classify: are there pieces you leave out? which pieces of data did you decide to disaggregated and which did you leave together.</p>
