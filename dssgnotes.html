<h1>Fundamentals of Digital Scholarship</h1>

<p>Example  case is in letter correspondence networks.</p>

<p>Syntax: Digital Scholarship, including Digital History and Digital Humanities. <em>Digital scholarship</em> is a more neutral term.</p>

<p>Digital scholarship lends itself to interdisciplinary and awareness about the process.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Believes that digital scholarship requires a transparency about the methods (because of the guesswork).</li>
</ul>

<p>Speakers ascribed to the idea that more data = more information. Advocates that larger amounts of data do lend themselves to pattern recognition.</p>

<p>Use of machine learning to separate images from text based sources from a digitalized visual archive.</p>

<h2>What is data?</h2>

<p>Data requires variability</p>
<p>Information is "Data" + "Structure"</p>
<p>Data should be conceptualized as a human made structure of information. Data is not facts and it is not evidence. There is no such thing as raw data. Speaker uses a language of biased; manipulated might be a better term. One person reframes: there is no Platonic ideal of data.</p>
<p>Digital data is data that a computer can understand.</p>
<p>Unstructured data: text (without an organization background); Semi-structured data (text: perhaps annotated or tagged or catalogued); Structured data (where is explicit structure organizing the data, such as a well defined spreadsheet. Structure is one of the places where "bias" enters the data. Such as deciding which pieces of data to classify: are there pieces you leave out? which pieces of data did you decide to disaggregated and which did you leave together.</p>

<h2>"Flat" data  model</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All members of a set of information are related (of the same type)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hierarchicail data model</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Shows relationship between things: such as chronology, quantitative, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relational data model</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When tables have compartementalized/partitioned: useful in a one-to-many relationship (you have 1 of item A, which corresponds to stratefied options of &Alpha; &Beta;	&Gamma;)</li>
  </ul>

<p>iFrame: Used for embedding other digital information within a webpage</p>

<p>For instance, this is a copy-pasted iFrame embed from YouTube</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUicVnx1UKU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2>Client - Server Relationship</h2>
<p>When you type on a url, this goes to a server and the serve returns html, and your web browser uses this information</p>

<h2>Version control</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Word's</em> Track Changes</li>
  <li>Cloud file sync: OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Version control can be very useful in collaboration projects; this is more true when people annotate their changes.</p>

<p>Working in a text edittor with be much lighter than working in a word document</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you open a Word document in a text editor, it creates gobbledygook</li>
  <li>This gobbledygook start with a PK in the text edit: stands for Philip Katz (invented zip)</li>
  <li>You make is coherent by replacing the .docx with .zip before opening in the text editor</li>

</ul>

<h2>Character encoding</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Keyboards needed to be "mapped" to something</li>
   <li>ASCII Code: stardardized 7-bit ASCII (ignore the first zero)</li>
  <li>Historical query: Was this done with the English language first? Making a need to extend ASCII codes to include non-modern-English characters:medial "s"</li>
</ul>

<p>more on ASCII</p>
<ul>
  <li>7-bit ASCII = 2^7... [follow up required]</li>
</ul>

<p>Excel</P
<ul>
<li>.xsls</li>
<li>.csv (utf-8)</li>
</ul>

<p>HTML</p>
<ul>
  <li><meta charset='utf....</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Python</p>
    <ul>
    <li>#-*-coding: utf-8-*-</li>
    </li>
    

    <p>Text editors</p>
<ul>
    <li>Atom</li>
    <li>Notepad++</li>
    <li>Sublime</li>
    <li>Vim</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Google Drive</p>
<ul>
    <li>Google Docs</li>
    <li>Google Sheets</li>
    </ul>
                 
    <p>Databases</p>
          <ul>
    <li>Open source Solutions: SQLit; MySQL;Postgess...</li>
