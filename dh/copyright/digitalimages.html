<h1>Copyright and Licenses</h1>
</header>

		 	<h1><b>In assignments for my classes</b> you must ensure that you have the rights to use an image.</h1> 
	<h2><b<Why?</b>Digital humanities projects that could provoke a website be taken down due to copyright infringment cannot reach the public.</h2>

	<p>The internet presents many opportunities for information distribution and information sharing. 
Like material you will find in other places (academic journal article, scholarly monograph, cookbook, a novel, a painting, or a sculpture)
images found online can also be subject to copyright or various licenses.</p> 
	<p>For our purposes <em>copyright</em> means the protection of original works produced in a "tangible form" (the digital world is considered tangible in such contexts). 
		
		You can register your work with a copyright office, but you do not have to in order to have it protected. Copyright is automatically applied to anything you make. Whether it is published or unpublished. A piece of raw genius or a swing and a miss. Registering your material with a copyright office will make it easier to enforce copyright law, in the event that someone has reproduced your work without your permission. By default, unless a <em>copyright license</em> provides viewers with rights to reproduce the work, reproducing it risks copyright infringement.</p>
	<p>For our purposes a <em>copyright license</em> refers to legally a binding way for the creator of an original work to communicate the permissions, if any, regarding reproduction. If you do not attach a license saying otherwise, the work is covered under regular copyright law. There are many reasons that you might want to use different licenses. For instance, you might be fine with someone downloading an file of a photograph that you took from your personal website and using it for a school project, however, you might not be fine with someone financially profitting from your work (for instance, putting it on a post card and selling it). You might want to limit people's ability to modify your work (like cropping an image or changing its colour scheme) or you might like the idea that they could remix it. You might want people to use your work to attribute it (recognize where it came from) with specific language. Copyright licenese are one way of doing such goals. Copyright licenses are also the way that other organizations communicate their own conditions regarding the reproduction of their work.</p> 
<br>
	<h3>So how does copyright law impact the use of <em>visual</em> digital sources for public history?</h3>
	<p>Mass digitization projects have made a wealth of materials accessible for researchers. Depending on the kind of work that you are doing--textual analysis or material culture studies--seeing the "physical" artifact might matter more or less. There are whole websites dedicated to making historical material:  like old books, maps, and even music notation available to researchers. But, just because it is free to look at the pictures on a website, does not mean it is free to copy and redistribute those images.</p>
<p>For a list of potential digital repositories consult this webpage.</p> 
	<p><b>If</b> your digital humanities project has a visual component to it, you might want to integrate visual sources into your design. 
		<b>If</b> your digital humanities project will ultimately serve a public history end--that is, be accessible to anyone with internet access--
	then it must consider who owns the image you would like to reproduce. 
	In the United States the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">Digital Millenium Copyright Act Of 1998</a> means that when a website is reported as having violated copyright, it is immediately taken down. 
	If you want your website to be allowed back up, you carry the burden of proof that you have right to reproduced the material that you have distributed.</p>
	<p><em>Copyright law is still adapting to the digital age.</em></p> 
	<p>For instance, if I owned an original print copy of Buffon's <em>Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière avec la description du cabinet du roi</em>, the book and its contents would not be protected by any kind of copyright because it is more than 200 years old. By owning the physical copy, I could then reproduce images from the book and publish them.</p>
	<p>After I published an image copied from the <em>Histoire naturelle</em> (on the internet, in a book, on a billboard), I would then own the copyright to the image <em>as I reproduced it</em>. 
		This means that when someone else has reproduced images from a work that is no longer under copyright, they own the rights to those reproductions (assuming that they too, reproduced them legally). This means that when a digital repository makes digital copy of a work that is no longer undercopyright, the digital repository owns the copyright for the reproduction that they provided.</p> 
	<p>You can't just copy a copy.</p>
	<h3>How do you find out what permissions/restrictions apply to the digital image that you would like to copy and disseminate?</h3>
<p>Most online repositories will have statements about their terms of use. "Terms of use" means rights for reproduction. Finding a repository's terms of use can be tricky. Different websites use different words to describe their copyright restrictions.</p>
<p>Good search terms to find copyright information include: "terms of use", "reproduction," "copyright," "rights," "permissions,"  and "legal."</p>

<h4>Examples include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>"Copyright and reuse" as used by the <a href="https://about.biodiversitylibrary.org/help/copyright-and-reuse/">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>
	<li>"Copyright information" appears under the "about" section for the <a href="https://www.davidrumsey.com/about">David Rumsey Map Collection</a>
	<li>"Access and use" at <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/access_use">HathiTrust</a>
	<li>"Reproduction and image use" at the <a href="https://www.linnean.org/research-collections/access/images-scans-1">Linnean Society of London</a>
	<li>"Permission to use Images" is used by the <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services-public/access-documents/Pages/copyright-restrictions.aspx">Library and Archives of Canada</a>
<li>"About copyright and the Collections," is found under the category "Legal" by the<a href="https://www.loc.gov/legal/">Library of Congress</a>
</ul>
	<br>
	<p>So what do you do if you can't find a site's terms of use? Contact the organizaton hosting the material and ask.</p> 	
	
	<h3>So, you have found the section on what you can do and what you can't do with the material, what do their answers mean?</h3>
	<p>As copyright is a legal issue, sometimes the language used to describe it is jargon that you might not be used to. 
	A good starting point for understanding some of the terms of copyright can be found on the Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">website.</a></p>
	

	<br>
	<p>What should you do if you don't have the rights to reproduce an image?</p>
	<p><em>Don't use the image from that source.</em> Depending on the kind of primary source you are taking the work from, it is possible that multiple repositories will have the same text and might have different copyright restrictions/permissions.</p> 
	<p>However, images are--often--less important than you might think. A verbal description of the image and what is important about it would need to go into your work anyway. That can be sufficient. You can also hyperlink to the source and should cite it properly.  
		<em>See the section on "images and accessibility" here.</em></p>

		
		<h3>How to copyright your own work?</h3>
	<p><em>By default, your work is automatically under copyright.</em> Nevertheless you may wish to signal ownership of your work by including the copyright symbol, &copy;.</p>
			<p>BUT, depending on the license the images that you have taken from other repositories, those might restrict the kinds of copyright that you are allowed to assign your own work. For instance, if a digital image repository has what is called a "share alike" copyright, 
			in order to reproduce the image, you will need to use the same kind of license as the site you took the image from.</p>
