<h1>Copyright and Licenses</h1>
</header>
<p>The internet presents many opportunities for information distribution and information sharing. 
Like information you will find in an academic journal article, a scholarly monograph, a cookbook, or a novel, however, 
this material can also be subject to copyright or various licenses.</p> 
	<p>For our purposes <em>copyright</em>means the protection of original works produced in a "tangible form" (the digital world is considered tangible in such contexts). 
		This is true of published <em>and</em>unpublished works. It is not true of your ideas until they make it outside of your imagination. 
		You can register your work with a copyright office, but you do not have to in order to have it protected. Registering your material with a copyright office will make it easier to enforce.</p>
<br>
<h3>So what does that mean for you in drawing on digital sources?</h3>
<p>This page will deal with visual sources</p>
<br>
<p>There are a plethora of online collections that one can consult for primary source material. For a list of potential sources consult this webpage.</p> 
<br>
<p>If your digital humanities project has a visual component to it, you might want to integrate these sources into your design. If your digital humanities project will ultimately serve a public history end--that is, be accessible to anyone with internet access--then it must consider who owns the image you would like to reproduce</p>
<p>The copyright on digital images does not work exactly like the copyright of print images. For instance, if I owned an original print copy of Buffon's <em>Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière avec la description du cabinet du roi</em> from the eighteenth century, the work would not be covered by any kind of copyright. By owning the physical copy, I could then reproduce those images and publish them.</p>
<p>When I published them, I would then have the rights to the "copies" of the images that I reproduced. This means, that when someone else has reproduced these images, they own the rights to those reproductions (assuming that they too, reproduced them legally)</p>
<br>
<h3>So what do you do when you don't want to buy an expensive copy of an antique book that has a picture you would like to work with?</h3>
<p>Most online repositories will have statements about their terms of use. "Terms of use" means rights for reproduction. Finding these can sometimes be tricky, as different websites use different language to describe this.</p>
<h4>Examples include</h4>
<ul>
<li>"Copyright and reuse" as used by the <a href="https://about.biodiversitylibrary.org/help/copyright-and-reuse/">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>
	<li>"Copyright information" appears under the "about" section for the <a href="https://www.davidrumsey.com/about">David Rumsey Map Collection</a>
	<li>"Access and use" at <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/access_use">HathiTrust</a>
	<li>"Reproduction and image use" at the <a href="https://www.linnean.org/research-collections/access/images-scans-1">Linnean Society of London</a>
	<li>"Permission to use Images" is used by the <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services-public/access-documents/Pages/copyright-restrictions.aspx">Library and Archives of Canada</a>
<li>"About copyright and the Collections," is found under the category "Legal" by the<a href="https://www.loc.gov/legal/">Library of Congress</a>
</ul>
<p>Good search terms to find copyright information include: "terms of use", "reproduction," "copyright," "rights," "permissions,"  and "legal."</p>
	<br>
	<h3>What do their answers mean?</h3>
	<p>As copyright is a legal issue, sometimes the language used to describe it uses jargon that you might not be used to. 
	A good starting point for understanding some of the terms of copyright can be found on the Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">website.</a></p>
	
	<p>So what do you do if you can't find a site's terms of use? Contact the organizaton hosting the material and ask. 
	In assignments for my classes you must ensure that you have the rights to use an image. Digital public history projects that could be taken down due to copyright infringment cannot reach the public.</p> 
	<br>
	<p>What should you do if you don't have the rights to reproduce an image?</p>
	<p><em>Don't use the image.</em></p> 
	<p>However, you could describe the image and cite it properly. 
	You could create a hyperlink to the image. 
	You could decide that you don't actually need it.
		<em>See the section on "images and accessibility" here.</em></p>
		
		<h3>How to copyright your own work?</h3>
		<p><em>By default, your work is automatically under copyright. Nevertheless you may wish to signal ownership of your work by including the copyright symbol, &copy;.</p>
			<p>BUT, depending on the licenses that apply to the images that you have taken from other repositories, those might restrict the kinds of copyright that you are allowed to assign your own work. For instance, if a digital image repository has what is called a "share alike" copyright, 
			in order to reproduce the image, you will need to use the same kind of license as the site you took the image from.</p>
