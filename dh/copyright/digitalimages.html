<h1>Copyright</h1>
</header>
<p>The internet presents many opportunities for information distribution and information sharing. Like information you will find in an academic journal article, a scholarly monograph, a cookbook, or a novel, however, this material can also be subject to copyright.</p> 
<br>
<h3>So what does that mean for you in drawing on digital sources?</h3>
<p>This page will deal with visual sources</p>
<br>
<p>There are a plethora of online collections that one can consult for primary source material. For a list of potential sources consult this webpage.</p> 
<br>
<p>If your digital humanities project has a visual component to it, you might want to integrate these sources into your design. If your digital humanities project will ultimately serve a public history end--that is, be accessible to anyone with internet access--then it must consider who owns the image you would like to reproduce</p>
<p>The copyright on digital images does not work exactly like the copyright of print images. For instance, if I owned an original print copy of Buffon's <em>Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière avec la description du cabinet du roi</em> from the eighteenth century, the work would not be covered by any kind of copyright. By owning the physical copy, I could then reproduce those images and publish them.</p>
<p>When I published them, I would then have the rights to the "copies" of the images that I reproduced. This means, that when someone else has reproduced these images, they own the rights to those reproductions (assuming that they too, reproduced them legally)</p>
<br>
<h3>So what do you do when you don't want to buy an expensive copy of an antique book that has a picture you would like to work with?</h3>
<p>Most online repositories will have statements about their terms of use. "Terms of use" means rights for reproduction. Finding these can sometimes be tricky, as different websites use different language to describe this.</p>
