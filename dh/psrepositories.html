Most well-known, perhaps, are the Library’s extensive holdings in the literature of European exploration and travel in the Western Hemisphere, from the first Latin edition of the Columbus letter of 1493, through nearly all of the contemporary narratives of Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English discovery, exploration, and settlement. The John Carter Brown Library collection is entirely distinct from the Brown University Library collection and is 90% accessible online." (Retrieved from home page on 31 August 2019).</li>
