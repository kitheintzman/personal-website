The software in question: iNaturalist

Where it is available: www.inaturalist.org

A bit about the software and its function: It is a big-data citizen science project used to document ecological diversity at a global scale. There are all kinds of settings that one could use to protect your data, but a part of what I am interested in is seeing what happens if you don’t use those. Most people who don’t know anything about technology can’t really understand those trade offs. Much that one would intuitively use to control their personal data in the platform, actually hurts the value of the scientific data. It is open source, so a software engineer might be able  to  change things about it to  run a smaller scale project. But, that is not what I am interested in for the time being (beyond explaining  that though this control is possible, most people don’t know that about open source  and most people don’t how to program to exercise that power anyway). 

The task at its vaguest: go to iNaturalist, find my profile 

The expectations: Spend as much time on this project as you want. I am moderately tech savvy compared to the average bear and when I look at a profile I feel like I can learn a lot in 15-20 minutes, and that I can learn so much more if I spend longer on it. It would help if you documented about much time it took to get that information, but isn’t necessary.  

Let me know what you find. 

Bonus points if you say something creepy to me about it. Something that would feel weird coming from a stranger, ex, etc. 

Motivation: I’m an adjunct who gets no money for this and thus I can’t pay anyone to do it, so this is a “free labour”. The principle motivation for undertaking the task would be to better understand the intersections of free software, open data, stalkerware, and (more implicitly) the populations that are more likely to be impacted by it. 

All the information you have is already knowing the iterations of my name: Kit Heintzman, Kay Aitch,  Kat Heintzman, or Kathryn Heintzman to discern my profile, which for now will be  the hardest thing to  identify, but not that hard.
